# AdventOfCode
Advent of code 2023. Honestly I kinda just wanted an excuse to practise using github.

See the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for more details.

Inputs should be placed in inputs/{year}/{day}.txt

Solutions can be run by passing {year}/{day}/{part} as an argument, accepting * as a wildcard (IE 2023/*/1 runs the first part of each day in 2023).\
Adding -b (short for benchmark) times the solutions it runs.
